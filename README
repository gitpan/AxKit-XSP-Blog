AxKit/XSP/Blog
==============

What is it
----------

This is a rather _experimental_ package to syndicate several sources of weblogs,
consolidate them into a database and use the database entries when displaying
weblogs with AxKit.

How to install
--------------

The basic installation is done via the usual incantation:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Following files might be helpful (see below):

   cp support/blog_tags.xps    /where/ever/your/stylesheets/are/
   cp xslt/rss*                /where/ever/your/stylesheets/are/

How to use
----------

The model used here includes:

  (1) download weblog data from various sources and store the individule weblog entries in an DBI database
  (2) use an AxKit XSP taglib to expand the weblog entries into an XSP page
  (3) use the AxKit infrastructure to render the weblog-specific tags (into, say, HTML)

For (1) you may find the following utilities helpful

  - getblog

    Provided with some parameters, it will download the blog from those sources which allow you to read
    them via XML-RPC and will output it on STDOUT

  - blog2dbi

    Takes a blog on STDIN and saves it into a DBI database. Look at utilities/blogs.mysql for a DBI
    schema definition.

Blogs available from Userland.com, Blogger.com, .... can be imported like this

  getblog.pl --Username='user' --Password='xxxxx' --Proxy='http://plant.blogger.com/api/RPC2' --blogname='my blog' | blog2dbi.pl --dsn="dbi:mysql:database=topicmaps;user=nobody;table=blogs" --blog_uid='http://whatever.blogspot.com/'

Blogs which are only available as RSS (0.9, 0.91, 1.0 or 2.0) I have included rudimentary XSLT sheets
which allow you to convert the RSS stream into a XBlog XML document:

  GET http://radio.weblogs.com/01234567/rss.xml | xsltproc --param author_name "'First LastName'" --param author_email "'user@email.address'" ../xslt/rss2toblog.xslt - | blog2dbi.pl  --dsn="dbi:mysql:database=topicmaps;user=nobody;table=blogs" --blog_uid='http://radio.weblogs.com/01234567/'

I have reengineered the samples collected in the samples directory for that. Patches WELCOME.

For (2) please read the AxKit::XSP::Blog documentation.

For (3) I have included my version of an XPathScript doing the rendering (see support/blog_tags.xps)
